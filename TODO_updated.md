# Parent Login Fix

## Issues Identified:
- Parent login not working due to missing redirect logic in LoginPage component
- Parents get redirected to default route instead of `/parent` dashboard

## Plan:
1. ✅ Fix LoginPage redirect logic to handle 'Parent' role
2. ⏳ Test parent login functionality
3. ⏳ Verify parent dashboard loads correctly
4. ⏳ Test parent-specific features

## Files to Edit:
- ✅ `client/src/components/LoginPage.tsx` - Added parent role handling in redirect logic

## Changes Made:
- Added `else if (user.role === 'Parent') { navigate('/parent'); }` to the redirect logic in LoginPage component
- This ensures parents are properly redirected to their dashboard after successful login

## Next Steps:
- Test the parent login functionality to ensure it works correctly
- Verify that parents are redirected to `/parent` after login
- Test parent dashboard functionality
